#  Mini-Projects

This repository aggregates all my hands-on development projects—from AI-powered tools to NLP systems—all crafted using Python, ML, and web technologies.

##  Featured Projects

1. **AI‑Powered Resume Screening Tool**  
   A Streamlit app that processes job descriptions and ranks uploaded resumes (PDFs) by relevance using NLP-based similarity scoring.

2. **Real-Time Face Mask Detection System**  
   A webcam-based application leveraging MobileNetV2 and OpenCV to identify whether individuals in the frame are wearing masks.

3. **Fake News Detector**  
   A machine learning solution that classifies news articles as real or fake using TF‑IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression.

4. **Image Caption Generator**  
   Generates human-readable captions for images using an encoder-decoder architecture with InceptionV3 (CNN) and LSTM (RNN) on the Flickr8k dataset.

5. **Document-Based Question Answering (GenAI)**  
   A DocQA application capable of ingesting PDFs or Word documents and allowing context‑aware question-answering using local embedding models and similarity search.

##  How to Explore

Each project folder contains:

- A **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`) or Python script (`.py`) explaining the flow.
- Supporting assets like trained models, sample datasets, and instructions.
- A project-specific **README.md** with setup and usage details.

##  Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alfiya-Simran/Projects.git
   cd Projects
```
2. **Navigate to a project folder (e.g., 1.resume_screening_tool) and follow its README for setup instructions.**

3. **Set up a Python environment and install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook or Script—e.g., launch a Jupyter Notebook or execute a .py file.
```
